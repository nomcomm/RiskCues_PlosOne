This is expected since HIV risk is likely a \"compound impression\" and not neatly tied to e.g. the brightness of the image. However, to examine how the results change if we confine the data to concrete (clearly observable) cues, we run the same procedures using a reduced dataset."

    "Finally, we can train models to predict trust (or health, or attractiveness), and test how well these models would predict HIV risk. Of note, the behavior of these models can be guessed based on the relationships between these variables in the correlation table above. However, it could in principle be that there is a relationship between the variables (e.g. Risk and Trust), but that this reltionship arises from an entirely different cue-utilization process. In classical lens-model style analyses, this would be revealed by so-called vector-correlations, i.e. correlations between the cue-Risk correlation vector and the cue-Trust correlation vector. Our predictive modeling approach is really just another way to look at this phenomenon, i.e. whether same or different cues may drive the judgments. I would argue, though, that it has the advantage of being cross-validated."
